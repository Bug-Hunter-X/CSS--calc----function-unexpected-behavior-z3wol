The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it can lead to unexpected results if not used correctly. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not work as expected if the parent element's width isn't explicitly defined.  Another common issue is mismatched units, such as trying to subtract pixels from percentages without proper unit conversion.
